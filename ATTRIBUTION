FDEE Attribution & Notification Requirements

1. Mandatory Credit String

All derivative works must include:

"Encoded using FDEE (Fibonacci Delta Encoding Engine) © 2025 Tudor Simion (tudor@ipsilo.eu). Algorithm: Index ± Offset."

2. Public Project Notification

To satisfy the Author's requirement for architectural tracking and interest, users are required to send a "Notice of Implementation" to tudor@ipsilo.eu for any project that is made public.

Why this is required:
The Author tracks the implementation of FDEE across various sectors to monitor the evolution of the "Index ± Offset" logic in real-world environments.

Failure to notify:
Using FDEE in a public-facing project without notifying the author is a violation of the License Agreement.

3. Public-Facing Integration (About/Version Pages)

For projects with a User Interface (UI), the attribution must be accessible to the end-user. This ensures transparency and mathematical credit within the public domain:

"About" or "Credits" Pages: The credit string must be listed alongside other third-party libraries or core technologies.

Version Files (VERSION, CHANGELOG): If the project includes a version manifest or a "readme" for the public, FDEE must be mentioned as a core dependency for the data layer.

Metadata: In web-based projects, including the attribution in a humans.txt file or as a comment in the primary header of the public-facing site is highly encouraged.

Footer/Console: For developer-focused tools, a brief "Powered by FDEE" note in the CLI footer or initial console log is an acceptable alternative.
